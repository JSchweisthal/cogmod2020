# cogmod2020
Project for the course "Cognitive Modelling: Basic Principles and Methods" 2020/21 at the University Groningen (https://github.com/VanRijnLab/cogmod-bpm-2020).

The purpose of the course was to build cognitive models to simulate and reconstruct the results of the experiments of the papers of Jazayeri, Mehrdad, and Michael N. Shadlen. "Temporal context calibrates interval timing." Nature neuroscience 13.8 (2010): 1020-1026. and Acerbi, Luigi, Daniel M. Wolpert, and Sethu Vijayakumar. "Internal representations of temporal statistics and feedback calibrate motor-sensory interval timing." PLoS computational biology 8.11 (2012): e1002771.
